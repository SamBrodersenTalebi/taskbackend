# Getting Started with Create React App

Please install the necessary dependencies for this project with npm install command in the terminal.

tsc command was used to initialize the project generating tsconfi.json file with typescript configurations:
npm run tsc -- --init

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`:

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.
Note it's running on port 3001

### Converting data:

Initially I converted the data to json using convert-csv-to-json by running the following command:
node convertData.js inside of the services folder.

### Accessing the resources:

Access the resources by hitting the URL endpoints which can be found inside of the routes folder.

### Testing:

I have only tested on the frontend. I haven't done that much testing in my career so far. I could do it but I think I have exceed the recommended time you should spend on the task. But I hope it's okay!
